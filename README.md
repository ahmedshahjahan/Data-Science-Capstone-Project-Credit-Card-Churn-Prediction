**CREDIT CARD CUSTOMER ATTRITION (CHURN) PREDICTION**
Introduction
Building a predictive churn model helps us make proactive changes to the retention efforts that drive down churn rates. Understanding how churn impacts the current revenue goals and making predictions about how to manage those issues in the future also helps us stem the flow of churned customers. The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every online business. To gain revenue and retain customers flow, I have selected my capstone project topics as “Credit Card Customer Attrition (Churn) Prediction”.
